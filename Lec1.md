### Natural Language Processing  
Word 1 - apple - Vapple = {a<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>,...,a<sub>99</sub>,}  
Word 2 - banana - Vbanana = {b<sub>0</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>,b<sub>2</sub>,...,b<sub>99</sub>,}

Let's say apple and banana are similar - both fruit - we expect their vectors to be 'close' in a numerical way.  
One way to measure this closeness is with Euclidean Distance; e.g. the distance between Vapple and Vbanana is:

this is called the ' Statistical Approcah' to NLP
